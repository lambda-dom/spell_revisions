Range: Long
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 5' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, a pale glow surrounds and outlines all creatures within the area of effect, making their position and movements easily visible. Outlined creatures suffer a -2 penalty to AC for the duration of the spell. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The faerie fire does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.~

Area of Effect: 1 person
Saving Throw: None

This spell is only available to Harpers. The Harper's Call restores a comrade to life, to further serve the cause of the Harpers. This spell functions similarly to Raise Dead, with the following exceptions: the Harper must transfer a small portion of her life essence (10 hit points) to successfully raise the deceased person; the target has but 1 hit point when raised and must regain the rest by natural healing or curative magic; and the raised person suffers a -5 penalty to all ability scores for one minute, making this spell virtually useless in combat.~

Level: 7
School: Conjuration

Range: Long
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Special

When the caster utters the spell Creeping Doom, he calls forth a horde of venomous biting and stinging arachnids, insects, and myriapods. This carpet-like mass swarms over a large area, spreading to all creatures within 30 feet of the target.

For the duration of the spell, those affected fight with a -2 penalty to attack rolls and armor class. In addition, each round the victims suffer 2d3 points of damage from insect bites, have a 100% chance of spell failure, and must make saving throws vs. death at -2 or be poisoned and panic. If a successful save vs. breath at -4 is made, the target manages to avoid most of the swarm, reducing damage from bites by half and completely negating the spell failure penalty. Poisoned creatures suffer additional 2 points of damage each round for 3 rounds or until cured. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

Symbol of Stunning is a powerful enchantment that allows the caster to inscribe a symbol on the ground or any other surface. The symbol will remain there until a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, at which point it is triggered and explodes, causing all enemies within a 20 foot radius to make a saving throw vs. spell at -4 or be stunned for 4 rounds.~

@262=~Earthquake
Level: 7
School: Alteration
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: Long
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: Special

When this spell is cast by a druid, a local earthquake rips the ground. Once every round for the spell's duration, a tremor will take place, affecting all creatures in its area of effect. Earth elementals and flying creatures are unaffected by this spell.

There are three tremors that are caused by the earthquake. The first tremor causes all creatures affected to suffer 6d6 points of damage (save vs. paralyzation at -6 for half damage). Those who fail their saving throw fall to the ground unconscious for 2 rounds. The second tremor is less severe, causing 4d6 points of damage (save vs. death at -4 for half), but is accompanied by fissures opening in the earth, which all affected creatures have a 20% chance to fall into and die (save vs. breath at -4 negates). The final tremor causes 2d6 damage (save vs. death at -2 for half) and there is a 10% chance affected creatures will be trapped within the fissures, causing death (save vs. breath at -2 negates). Creatures knocked unconscious by the first tremor automatically fail any saves to try to avoid falling into or becoming trapped in the fissures.

This spell will affect both enemies and friends of the caster, so care must be taken in its use. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

Creatures with more than 60 current hit points are immune to this effect.~
