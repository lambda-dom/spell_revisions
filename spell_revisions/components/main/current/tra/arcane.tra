@440=~Find Familiar
Level: 1
School: Universal
Range: Short
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to summon a familiar to act as his aide and companion. Familiars are typically small creatures. A creature acting as a familiar can benefit a wizard, conveying its sensory powers to its master, conversing with him, and serving as a guard/scout/spy as well. A wizard can have only one familiar at a time, and he has no control over what sort of creature answers the summoning, if any come at all. Note that this spell may only be cast by the protagonist.

The creature is always more intelligent than others of its type (typically by 2 or 3 intelligence points), and its bond with the wizard confers upon it an exceptionally long life. The wizard has an empathic link with the familiar and can issue it mental commands. The caster receives half the familiar's total hit points as bonus hit points. However, the caster must take care to treat his familiar well, for if the familiar should die, the caster will lose the bonus hit points and half the familiar's hit points again as damage. Also, when a familiar dies, the caster loses 1 point of constitution permanently.

Example: A mage has 15 hit points and casts Find Familiar. The imp summoned has 24 hit points, so the caster gets a bonus of 12 hit points. The caster now has 27 hit points. If the familiar dies, the caster will lose those additional 12 hit points (putting him back at 12), permanently lose 1 point of constitution (which may cause additional hit point loss), and take 12 damage.

Here is a list of the familiars that the player receives according to alignment:

LAWFUL GOOD, NEUTRAL GOOD:  Pseudo Dragon
CHAOTIC GOOD:  Fairy Dragon

LAWFUL NEUTRAL:  Ferret
NEUTRAL:  Rabbit
CHAOTIC NEUTRAL:  Cat

LAWFUL EVIL:  Imp
NEUTRAL EVIL:  Dust Mephit
CHAOTIC EVIL:  Quasit

@548=~Dispel Magic
Level: 3
School: Abjuration
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 20' radius
Saving Throw: Special

Dispel Magic removes magical effects upon any enemies within the area of effect. This includes effects from spells, potions, and certain magical items such as wands. It does not, however, affect enchanted magical items or spell protections such as Spell Deflection. While this spell dispels the individual effects of Grease, Web, Stinking Cloud, and other such spells, it does not dispel the area of effect. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.

The chance of the dispel succeeding is determined by the level of the caster and the level of the magic being dispelled. The base chance of successfully dispelling is 50%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is above the level of the magic he is trying to dispel, his chance of success increases by 5%. For every level that the caster of Dispel Magic is below the level of the magic he attempts to dispel, his chance of success decreases by 10%. However, despite the difference in levels, there is always at least a 1% chance of success or failure. Thus, if a caster is 10 levels higher than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 1% chance of failure. Similarly if the caster is 4 levels lower than the magic he is trying to dispel, there is only a 10% chance of success. Intuitively, this spell is almost useless if the level of the magic attempted to dispel is 5 or more levels higher than the caster.~

Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative, but it can be used in conjunction with similar spells. Tiny and small flying creatures cannot pass through the caustic barrier. Magic resistance does not affect this spell.~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Special

By means of this spell, the wizard creates the illusion of a door. The illusion also permits the wizard to appear to step through this "door" and disappear. In reality he has darted aside and can flee, totally invisible, for the spell duration. Opponents within 5 feet of the caster must save vs. spell or be fooled into following the caster through the door, becoming trapped in an extradimensional room for up to 4 rounds. Creatures with exceptional intelligence may escape the illusion faster, while creatures who can see through illusions (e.g. dragons, liches, demons), or are under the effects of a True Seeing spell, are unaffected.~

School: Enchantment

Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Spell negates

The Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of any one creature while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victim. Unlike the 4th level priest spell Mental Domination, the target has no option for release, even if made to do something against his morals. The target gets a saving throw vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the effect.~

Saving Throw: Spell negates

This spell holds creatures of any type rigidly immobile and in place for one turn. The effect is centered on the victim selected by the caster. Every enemy within 5 feet of the target is also affected. Those who succeed at a saving throw vs. spell at -2 are totally unaffected by the spell. Undead creatures cannot be held with this spell.

Held creatures cannot move or speak, but they remain aware of events around them even though they are helpless to change them. Time passes at a normal rate for the targets and hence being held does not stop any worsening of their condition due to wounds, disease, or poison.~

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by non-magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground).

@637=~Lower Resistance~
@638=~Lower Resistance
Level: 5
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When cast upon a target creature, this spell will lower their magic resistance by 2% per level of the caster (up to a maximum of 40% at 20th level). There is no saving throw vs. this spell and magic resistance is ignored. This spell is not affected by dispel magic. Once it has been cast, there is no way to cancel the effects until the spell expires.

For example, if a creature has 50% magic resistance and this spell is cast on it by a 15th level mage, then its magic resistance would be lowered by 30% automatically. This effect is cumulative for each casting of this spell. If this spell was cast upon this same creature again, the creature's magic resistance would be 50% - 30% (initial casting) - 30% (current casting) which would leave the creature with 0% magic resistance after both spells have been cast.~

Upon casting Conjure Lesser Fire Elemental, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. The elemental has 8 Hit Dice and will serve the caster's every whim until banished back to its home plane, the spell duration expires, or upon the elemental's death. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

@646=~Phantom Blade
Level: 5
School: Illusion

Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a translucent, weightless, shadowlike sword made of material from the Plane of Shadow that extends 3 feet from the caster's hand. The caster wields the phantom blade as if it was a long sword but he suffers no penalty for non-proficiency. The sword deals 1d12+4 points of magic damage to its victims, and an additional 10 points of damage against undead creatures. Due to its ethereal nature, strength bonuses do not apply, but attacks with the phantom blade are considered melee touch attacks, and thus gain a +4 bonus to hit. Furthermore, a successful strike temporarily scrambles magic, causing any spells the target casts in the next round to fail (save vs. spell at a -4 penalty negates). The blade is considered to be of +4 enchantment when determining what it can hit, but it cannot harm inorganic things because it has no solid existence. The phantom blade can only be used by the caster, and remains in his hand for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

When this spell is cast the wizard is protected from the next magical attack against him. If one of those spells is cast at the wizard this spell activates and absorbs the attack. However, this only works once as this spell is consumed in the process.

Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 7th level spell. Spells greater than 7th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).~

This spell creates an explosive burst of flame that detonates with a low roar and delivers damage proportional to the level of the wizard who cast it, similar to a fireball. The wizard gestures with his hand and the entire area around him erupts in flames, striking all except the caster for 1d6 points of damage per level of the wizard (up to a maximum of 15d6). Creatures who fail their saving throw vs. breath at -4 suffer full damage from the blast. Those who roll successful saving throws manage to dodge, fall flat, or roll aside, each receiving half damage.~

This spell summons an invisible stalker from the Elemental Plane of Air. This 8 hit dice monster obeys and serves the spellcaster in performing whatever tasks are set before it, even if this means being sent to certain death. The creature remains under the caster's control for 8 hours or until it is killed - at which point it will return to its native plane, only slightly annoyed at having to serve a mortal.

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that prevents any 1st-, 2nd-, 3rd- or 4th-level spell effects from penetrating (i.e., the area of effect of any such spells does not include the area of the globe of invulnerability). This includes innate abilities and effects from devices. However, any type of spell can be cast out of the magical sphere, and these pass from the caster of the globe to their subject without affecting the globe. Fifth and higher level spells are not affected by the globe. The globe can be brought down by a successful dispel magic spell, as well as other forms of magical attack such as Pierce Magic and Spellstrike.~

Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

Tenser's Transformation is a sight guaranteed to astound any creature not aware of its power. For when the mage casts the spell, he undergoes a startling transformation which alters his body and his mind into that of a warrior. The wizard gains 2 hit points per caster level (up to a maximum of 40), and all damage he sustains comes first from the magical points gained. The armor class of the caster is 4 better than he possessed prior casting the spell, and all attack rolls are made with the THAC0 of a fighter of the same level as the caster. The mage gains extra attacks as a fighter of the same level, thus an extra half attack per round at 7th level and another half attack per round at 13th level. Furthermore, each attack is made at +2, each successful hit in combat inflicts an additional 2 points of damage, and saving throws against death/poison are made by the caster with a +4 bonus, but casting speed is penalized by 2 and saving throws against spell are made by the caster with a -2 penalty.

Note: this spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/mages, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter levels.~

Flesh to Stone is a powerful magic that permanently turns the flesh of the creature affected into stone. When struck by this spell the target is slowed for 3 rounds as its flesh begins to harden. The following round the subject of the spell must save vs. petrification at -4 or be turned into a statue. A dispel magic spell cannot restore the victim's natural form, but some powerful spells, such as Stone to Flesh or Freedom, can. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or incorporeal creatures.~

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast the wizard is affected with an Improved Invisibility spell and is teleported a few feet away from his original position. Meanwhile an exact image of the caster is created where he used to be with exactly the same hit points as the caster. The illusory double vanishes after 6 rounds and cannot perform any actions at all, like attacking or casting spells. It can, however, move around and act as a decoy for the invisible mage. As long as the image isn't destroyed, the caster can attack and cast spells while remaining completely hidden. The image will remain under the control of the caster until it is reduced to 0 hit points, or until it is affected by a dispel magic or a spell that destroys the illusion.~

Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast upon a target creature there will be two major effects. The first is that it will dispel one spell protection of 8th level or lower from the creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. The second effect of the spell is that the creature's magic resistance is temporary nullified. The resistance remains lowered for 2 rounds, and this effect cannot be negated in any way. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Magic are: Minor Spell Deflection, Non-Detection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Spell Shield, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection and Shield of the Archons.~

Area of Effect: 30' radius
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster gains the ability to see the exact locations of creatures or objects under displacement or invisibility effects, and see through illusions. This effectively neutralize spells such as Blur and Mirror Image, allow the caster to see and target invisible creatures normally, and make him unaffected by hostile illusion spells such as Spook. The caster is also cured from any form of blindness and is immune to it for the duration of the spell.

Note: True Seeing does not dispel illusionary clones such as those conjured by Mislead or Simulacrum, but instead clearly highlights them, revealing them as deceptions.~

School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an immobile, faintly shimmering magical sphere around the caster that cannot be penetrated by magical weapons; all such weapons are harmlessly deflected (missile weapons strike the sphere, then immediately fall to the ground). This includes weapons that are blessed or enchanted as well as attacks of especially powerful monsters. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat. The spell's effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled.~

When this spell is cast, each affected creature functions at double normal movement rate, gains a +2 bonus to attack rolls, armor class, and saving throws vs. breath, and can make one extra attack each round. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. There are two major differences between the third level wizard spell Haste and this spell. The first major difference is that there is no period of fatigue following the expiration of this spell. The other major difference is that Improved Haste cannot be countered by Slow.~

Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 30'
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell creates an electrical discharge that begins as a single stroke commencing from the caster's fingertips. Unlike Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning strikes one object or creature initially, then arcs to other targets. These brilliant arcs of lightning leap at all enemies within range, burning them with electrical damage. The lightning causes 1d6 points of damage for every level of the caster to the primary target (up to a maximum of 20d6) and 1d6 for every two levels to subsequent targets (up to a maximum of 10d6). Those who roll successful saving throws vs. breath at -4 manage to partially avoid direct impact from the lightning and hence receive only half damage.~

Saving Throw: Breath partial

Upon casting this spell at another creature, a thin green ray shoots unerringly from the caster's fingertip toward the target. Upon contact, the creature must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.~

@691=~Contingency~
@692=~Contingency
Level: 6
School: Universal
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell out of his repertoire of known spells. The spell level must be lower or equal to the level of the caster divided by three. Once the spell is chosen, the caster is allowed to choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of his maximum hit points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically. For example, a 12th level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a contingency with the starting condition being 'the wizard reaches 50% of his maximum hit points'. Then once the wizard is reduced to 50% or less of his total hit points in combat, Stoneskin would be immediately cast upon him. This requires no action by the wizard, happening automatically and instantaneously. The limitation of this spell is that the target of the spell placed in the contingency must be the caster. Therefore, the spell stored cannot be an offensive spell nor can it target any other party members.~

@694=~Spell Deflection
Level: 6
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 9 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 7th level spell. Spells greater than 7th level will not be affected. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud).~

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting a Conjure Fire Elemental spell, the caster opens a special gate to the Elemental Plane of Fire, and a fire elemental is summoned to the vicinity of the spellcaster. Normally, an elemental with 12 hit dice will be conjured. At fifteenth level and above, however, the caster will be able to summon an elemental with 16 hit dice. The elemental will do the bidding of the caster until it is slain or the duration of the spell runs out. All of the commands given to the elemental are done so telepathically, so there is no time lost due to miscommunication, and it is not necessary to know the language of the summoned creature. It is particularly difficult to maintain a gate to the Inner Planes - there is a 15% chance that the portal opened by the caster will collapse before the elemental enters the Prime Material Plane.

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting the Summon Nishruu spell, the wizard calls into existence a magical being of considerable power, the Nishruu. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination the churning red mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the Nishruu feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Nishruus do not use physical attacks, and they disregard physical attacks made on them, though these attacks can hurt them. Each time a Nishruu touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from him. Excluding Banishment or a dispel magic, the Nishruu is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, dispelled, or the spell duration expires.

The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Mages are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on his summoner at the first available opportunity.

Duration: 8 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By casting the Summon Hakeashar spell, the wizard calls into existance a magical being of considerable power, the Hakeashar. The Hakeashar is a more powerful version of the Nishruu, having more hit points, better attacks, and immunity to normal weapons. At first glance, this appears to be some sort of mist, but upon closer examination the churning grey mass of vapors and shapes moves with a life of its own. Drawn towards magic like a moth to the flame, the Hakeashar feeds on the energies surrounding and used by wizards. Luckily, there is no question as to the loyalty of the creature and it will not attack its summoner even though it would like nothing better. Hakeashars do not use physical attacks, and they disregard physical attacks made on them, though these attacks can hurt them. Each time a Hakeashar touches and wraps its tendrils around a target, it will drain magical energies from him. Excluding Banishment or a dispel magic, the Hakeashar is completely immune to magic, and not only that, but magic will actually heal this creature. The creature will remain under the wizard's control until reduced to 0 hit points, dispelled, or the spell duration expires.

- causes feeblemindedness (save vs. spell neg.)

Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Target, and enemies within 5'
Saving Throw: Special

The Control Undead spell allows the caster to take control of undead creatures within the area of effect. This creates a telepathic link between the caster and the undead, allowing complete control. If the undead have 5 or more Hit Dice/levels less than the caster then there is no saving throw allowed, else a save vs. spell at -6 is allowed to negate the effect. The undead remain under control of the caster for the duration of the spell or until they are affected by a dispel magic.~

@760=~Limited Wish
Level: 7

Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Limited Wish is a very potent but difficult spell. It will fulfill literally, but only partially or for a limited duration, the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. The use of a Limited Wish will not substantially change major realities. The spell can, for example, restore some hit points lost by the wizard. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. Lastly, the wiser the wizard, the better chance that he will choose the right wording. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~

@768=~Ghostform
Level: 8
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of his gear assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 enchantment or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Even when hit by magical attacks, any physical damage sustained while in ghost form is reduced by 50%. Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).

As an incorporeal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard (+100% Move Silently) or backstabbed. While in ghost form, the caster has a base armor class of 0 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison. Any melee attack made while in ghost form is considered a melee touch attack and thus gains a +4 bonus to the attack roll, while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange.~

When this spell is cast, the caster taps energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of himself. The duplicate is a near-perfect copy of the caster, making it a very powerful ally. The simulacrum is created at 60% of the level of the caster and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level. It also has 60% of the hit points of the caster. The simulacrum is fully under the control of the caster. The caster may have only one simulacrum at a time.~

By means of this spell, the wizard may launch a massive attack on a target's physical and magical defenses. Pierce Shield will dispel one spell protection of any level from the target creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. After piercing through magical protections, this powerful spell will breach each and every combat protection on the target creature. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Glabrezu, one of the most powerful specimen of the Tanar'ri. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Mages are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated fiend will turn on his summoner at the first available opportunity.

This spell grants an almost omniscient perception of things to come. For the duration of the spell the mage's armor class is improved by 20 points, and any save is made by the caster with a +20 bonus. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of intense combat.~

The symbol will remain there until a hostile creature comes within 15 feet of the glyph, at which point it is triggered and explodes, causing all enemies within a 20 foot radius to make a saving throw vs. spell at -4 or suffer a -4 penalty to strength, dexterity, and constitution.

Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster.

Upon casting a Time Stop spell, the wizard causes the flow of time to stop in the entire area that the caster is currently in. Outside this area the sphere simply seems to shimmer for an instant. Inside the sphere, the caster is free to act for three rounds of apparent time. The wizard can move and act freely within the area where time is stopped, but all other creatures are frozen in their actions, for they are literally between ticks of the time clock. Nothing can enter the area of effect without being stopped in time also. When the spell duration ceases, everyone is again operating in normal time.

The victim remains there unless the reverse of the spell, Freedom, is cast. Otherwise, the victim will remain imprisoned for 1 turn at the end of which it will die a horrible, despairing death by asphyxiation. If a Freedom spell is cast in the area where the creature was imprisoned then he will reappear exactly where he was last standing. Dispel magic will not free creatures trapped in this manner.

Creatures who currently have 60 or more hit points can save vs. spell to avoid the effects, but those with 1 to 59 hit points are powerless to resist.

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life from a living creature and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane, draining him of 4 levels of experience. The target of this spell loses levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities permanently. These levels can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell. As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill. These effects last for 1 hour. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.~

It jumps into the caster's hand and is used as a normal sword, remaining there for the duration of the spell. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~

With this spell, a wizard is able to assume the form of a powerful creature: that of an iron golem, a mind flayer, a greater wolfwere, or a spirit troll. The spellcaster becomes the creature he wishes, and gains almost all of its natural abilities. The caster's mental attributes are not affected, but physical attributes are changed to adhere to the new form. All clothes and equipment he was wearing will mold into the new form and continue to function, unseen. When the wizard returns to his natural form, they will also return to their previous state.

@841=~Wish~
@842=~Wish
Level: 9
School: Universal
Range: Personal
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Wish is a more potent version of the Limited Wish spell. It will fulfill literally the utterance of the spellcaster. Thus, the actuality of the past, present, or future might be altered (but possibly only for the wizard unless the wording of the spell is most carefully stated) in some limited manner. Greedy desires usually end in disaster for the wisher. The wiser the wizard, the better chance that the right wording will be chosen. Wizards with low wisdom will more often than not meet with disaster when asking for a wish.~
