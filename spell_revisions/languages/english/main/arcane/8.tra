Level: 8
School: Alteration
Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the wizard and all of his gear assume a visible, incorporeal form like that of a manifesting ghost. The caster is subject only to magical or special attacks, including those by weapons of +1 enchantment or better, or by creatures otherwise able to affect those struck only by magical weapons. Even when hit by magical attacks, any physical damage sustained while in ghost form is reduced by 50%. Non-damaging spell effects affect the caster normally unless they require corporeal targets to function (e.g. Polymorph Other, Flesh to Stone, Disintegrate, and Implosion) or create a corporeal effect that incorporeal creatures would normally be unaffected by (e.g. Entangle, Grease, and Web).

As an incorporeal creature, the caster moves silently and cannot be heard (+100% Move Silently) or backstabbed. While in ghost form, the caster has a base armor class of 0 and is immune to the effects of disease and poison. Any melee attack made while in ghost form is considered a melee touch attack and thus gains a +4 bonus to the attack roll, while projectiles become corporeal as soon as they are fired. The transformation lasts until successfully dispelled or until the duration runs out, but cannot be used in conjunction with other shapeshifting spells such as Polymorph Self and Shapechange."

Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it confers complete protection from all energy attacks composed of acid, cold, electricity, fire, or magic damage, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the energy damage from attacks with weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of energy-based spells. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled."

Level: 8

Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster taps energy from the Plane of Shadow to create a quasi-real, illusory version of himself. The duplicate is a near-perfect copy of the caster, making it a very powerful ally. The simulacrum is created at 60% of the level of the caster and has all the spells and abilities that the caster would have at that level. It also has 60% of the hit points of the caster. The simulacrum is fully under the control of the caster. The caster may have only one simulacrum at a time."

School: Abjuration
Range: Long
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the wizard may launch a massive attack on a target's physical and magical defenses. Pierce Shield will dispel one spell protection of any level from the target creature. This will always dispel the highest level of spell protection on the target first. If the target has two or more protections tied for the highest level, the choice will be random. After piercing through magical protections, this powerful spell will breach each and every combat protection on the target creature. The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell.

The spell protection spells dispelled by Pierce Shield are: Minor Spell Deflection, Minor Globe of Invulnerability, Spell Deflection, Dispelling Screen, Globe of Invulnerability, Greater Spell Deflection, Shield of the Archons and Spell Trap.

The combat protection spells dispelled by Pierce Shield are: Mage Armor, Shield, Armor of Faith, Barkskin, Protection from Missiles, Spirit Armor, Stoneskin, Protection from Normal Weapons, Protection from Magical Weapons, Physical Mirror, Prismatic Mantle, Moment of Prescience and Absolute Immunity."
