This spell generates a billowing cloud of ghastly, yellowish green vapors that is so toxic as to slay any creature with fewer than 4 Hit Dice, and cause creatures with 4 to 6 Hit Dice to roll saving throws vs. poison with -4 penalties or be slain. Holding one's breath has no effect on the lethality of the spell. Those with more than 6 Hit Dice must leave the cloud immediately, or suffer 1d10 points of poison damage each round while in the area of effect.
