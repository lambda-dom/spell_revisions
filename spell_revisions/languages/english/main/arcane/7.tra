Level: 7
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

This abjuration spell causes any spells cast against the wizard to be absorbed and consumed. This affects a total of 12 spell levels, but having 1 level left of protection means a 1st level spell would get absorbed, as well as a 9th level spell. This spell will not protect the caster from a dispel magic. However, it will not be affected by a dispel magic, either.

This spell absorbs spells cast from scrolls and innate spell-like abilities, but will not protect against area effect spells that are not centered directly upon the wizard (such as Fireball), or stationary area effect spells (such as Cloudkill and Stinking Cloud)."

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it confers complete protection from all elemental attacks composed of acid, cold, electricity, or fire, whether magical or non-magical in origin. 100% of the elemental damage from attacks with weapons, wands, breath weapons, etc. will be absorbed, and the target creature will become completely immune to the effects of elemental spells. This effect lasts for the duration of the spell or until dispelled."

Range: Personal
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, an illusory copy of the casting wizard appears to step out of his body while at the same time the mage is concealed with invisibility. The image can move around, and has the same hit points and can cast the same spells as the wizard, but it cannot make any physical attacks. The caster must maintain concentration on the illusory clone for the duration of the spell and cannot perform any other action while controlling it. If the image is destroyed then the spell ends and the caster can move again. If during this time the caster takes any damage, the image will disappear and the caster will be free to move around once more. Otherwise, the image will remain for the duration of the spell or until affected by a dispel magic or destroyed."

Level: 7
School: Necromancy
Range: Medium
Duration: 3 turns
Casting Time: 1 round
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

By means of this spell, the caster calls an outer planar creature to attack his foes and himself if not careful. The creature summoned in is a Death Knight, a powerful undead demon. The creature cannot be directly controlled, but the summoner can attempt to compel the demon to perform a service for him for the duration of the spell. Charismatic and powerful casters may bind the creature's will, intelligent and wise ones may negotiate with it, but dealing with these demonic creatures is always dangerous, and sometimes it may lead to disaster. Mages are warned to be careful of this spell, for a mistreated Death Knight will turn on his summoner at the first available opportunity.

Level: 7
School: Abjuration
Range: Personal
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: partial

When this spell is cast, an opaque globe of shimmering, multicolored light temporarily surrounds the caster. This magical mantle confers complete invulnerability to all weapons of +3 or less enchantment. Furthermore, opponents within a 10' radius that hit the caster with a weapon or spell are subject to a random prismatic effect once per round. The possible effects of the prismatic mantle are listed below. Due to this spell's short casting time and duration, it is mainly used to buy the wizard a few rounds in the thick of combat.

Red    - 6d6 fire damage (save vs. breath half)
Orange - 6d6 acid damage (save vs. breath half)
Yellow - 6d6 electrical damage (save vs. breath half)
