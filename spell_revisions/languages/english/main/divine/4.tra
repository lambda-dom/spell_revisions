Saving Throw: Spell negates

When cast upon a subject, he must make a save vs. spell at -2 in order to avoid the priest entering his mind. The effects of this spell are similar to the 5th level wizard spell Domination, with a few minor differences. Most notably, this spell gives the priest no access to the subject's thoughts, memory, or sensory apparatus. The priest simply is able to command the subject to perform certain tasks or functions during the spell duration. To control the subject, the priest must be within range and must be able to see the subject. This control will last until dispelled or for the duration of the spell."

Saving Throw: None

Through this spell, the caster imbues himself with the strength and skill of a fighter of the same level.

This lasts for the duration of the spell or until successfully dispelled. Multiple castings of this spell are not cumulative.

Note: this spell does not give any extra attacks to multiclassed or dual-classed fighter/clerics or ranger/clerics, as they normally gain additional attacks per round due to their fighter or ranger levels."
